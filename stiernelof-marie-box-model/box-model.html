		<h2 id="about">About</h2>
		<p>
			Saga is an epic space opera/fantasy comic book series written by Brian K. Vaughan 
			and illustrated by Fiona Staples, published monthly by Image Comics. The series is 
			heavily influenced by Star Wars, and is based on ideas Vaughan conceived both as a 
			child and as a parent. It depicts two lovers from long-warring extraterrestrial races, 
			Alana and Marko, fleeing authorities from both sides of a galactic war as they 
			struggle to care for their newborn daughter, Hazel, who occasionally narrates the 
			series. 
		</p>
		<h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>
		<h3>Alana</h3>
		<p>
			The female lead of the series, Alana is a native of the technologically advanced 
			Landfall, the largest planet in the galaxy, whose people have 
			wings that give them the power of flight. She was drafted into her planet's war 
			against the Wreathers, after she dropped out of state college, and was subsequently 
			reprimanded for "abject cowardice" following her first experience in battle,
			Countess Robot X, ordered her to destroy a bridge to prevent it 
			being used by Wreath troops. Alana initially refused because the bridge was 
			filled with civilians. When pressed by the Countess, who pointed out that any 
			military-age civilian not actively resisting Wreathers was a "clean target", 
			Alana complied, but was nonetheless punished by the Countess for her hesitancy 
			by being redeployed to the planet Cleave, where as a prison guard 
			she met Marko. When Alana learned that Marko was to be 
			transferred to Blacksite, a prison from which detainees never return, she freed him 
			from his shackles so that he could escape, just twelve hours after having met him. 
			She later married him, and gave birth to their daughter, Hazel.
		</p>
		<h3>Marko</h3>
		<p>
			The male lead of the series, Marko is from the Landfall's moon Wreath, whose people 
			have horns or antlers and can wield magic. Marko was a foot soldier in his people's war 
			against the Coalition of Landfall.When Marko left Wreath, he was still 
			"a gung-ho kid who just wanted to do [his] moon proud and kick some ass." 
			This all changed when the first time he saw battle, after which he began to develop 
			a less militant and more pacifist outlook. When he tried to share these misgivings 
			with his fiancée Gwen, he realized from her unsympathetic responses that they had 
			grown too far apart to continue their relationship. Marko surrendered to Coalition 
			forces as a "conscientious objector" 18 months before the beginning of the series. 
			He was a prisoner of war on the planet Cleave until his guard, Alana, escaped with him.
		</p>
		<h3>Hazel</h3>
		<p>
			The daughter of the two lead characters, born in the first issue, who occasionally narrates 
			the series. She has wings like her mother, horns like her father, and green-brown eyes unlike 
			that of either of her parents. She spends most of her childhood growing up on 
			the organic tree-like rocketship with which she and her parents escape Cleave.
		<p>
		<h3>Prince Robot IV</h3>
		<p>
			A member of the royal family of the Robot Kingdom, employed by Landfall as their 
			primary pursuer of Alana and Marko. Like others of his race, he is a humanoid with a small 
			television set for a head, which Vaughan explains is influenced by a fascination with 
			old televisions that he developed when he began writing for TV.
			A scene in the first issue depicts two of the Robots having sex, which Vaughan 
			says is "actually vitally important to our larger story, so I'm grateful that Fiona 
			was deranged enough to show our bluebloods in their (mostly) anatomically correct 
			splendor." His wife is pregnant with their first child, but he feels he will 
			only be able to witness the birth if he captures Alana in time. 
		</p>
		<h3>Special Agent Gale</h3>
		<p>
			The agent from Landfall's from Secret Intelligence to whom Prince Robot IV answers. 
			After he learns that two journalists, Upsher and Doff, are investigating Alana's story, 
			he seeks out freelance assassins to put a stop to their investigation.
		</p>
		<h3>The Will</h3>
		<p>
			Wreath's primary pursuer of the two fugitives, The Will is one of the freelance bounty 
			hunters hired by the Wreath High Commandto kill Marko and Alana, not only for 
			Marko's betrayal, but also so that news of the coupling does not spread and threaten 
			troop morale. The Will is accompanied by the Lying Cat.
		</p>
		<h3>Lying Cat</h3>
		<p>
			Lying Cat is a green, talking feline companion to The Will who aids him in his work. 
			As indicated by his name, she has the ability to detect when a verbal statement is 
			a lie, which he indicates by saying, "Lying". Lying Cat's abilities 
			are not limited to detecting to detecting deception by someone who knowingly tells a falsehood, 
			but can also detect when a statement is untrue as a question of fact, even when 
			the speaker believes the statement to be true.</p>
		<h3>Izabel</h3>
		<p>
			One of Cleave's "horrors", Izabel is the ghost of a teenage girl who was killed by 
			a landmine. She manifests as a reddish torso with her intestines hanging out from 
			under the hem of her T-shirt. She makes a deal with Alana to save Marko's life in 
			exchange for being taken with them when they leave the planet, but to do so has to 
			bond her soul to Hazel's.
		</p>
		<h3>Gwendolyn</h3>
		<p>
			Marko's former fiancée. She is first mentioned by a semi-conscious Marko at the end 
			of issue #3. Gwendolyn first appears at the end of issue #8, having been assigned 
			by the Secretary General of Wreath High Command to check on The Will.
		</p> 
		<h3>Sophie</h3>
		<p>
			A six-and-a-half-year-old former sex slave, initially known only as Slave 
			Girl, that The Will discovers on the pleasure planet Sextillion.
			He and Gwendolyn rescue her, after which the girl reveals she possesses the power 
			of psychometry, with which she helps The Will track Marko and Alana.
		</p>
		<h3>Barr</h3>
		<p>
			Marko's father, who first appears with Marko's mother at the end of issue #6. Unlike 
			his wife, Barr is immediately accepting of Alana's relationship with Marko.
		</p>
		<h3>Klara</h3>
		<p>
			Marko's mother, who first appears with Marko's father at the end of issue #6. Her 
			mother died in an incident at Langencamp at the hands of Landfallians, and thus 
			Klara is less accepting of Marko and Alana's relationship.
		</p>
		<h3>D. Oswald Heist</h3>
		<p>
			A novelist whose works include In Lieu of Flowers and A Nighttime Smoke, the latter 
			of which is long out of print. Heist now lives in an old lighthouse near a quarry
			 on the fog-covered "lighthouse planet" Quietus,
			where Marko and Alana's family take refuge, after having been inspired by the antiwar 
			message in A Nighttime Smoke.
		</p>
		<h3>Upsher and Doff</h3>
		<p>
			Upsher and Doff are a tabloid journalist and photographer, respectively, from 
			the planet Jetsam, who work for a tabloid called The Hebdomadal, and who are also 
			lovers, despite the fact that Jetsam, a fledgling planet, suffers from 
			institutionalized homophobia.[37] They first appear in issue #13, alerted to the 
			pairing of Alana and Marko by one of the Landfallian soldiers severely injured by 
			Marko in issue #5. They experience more than one confrontation with Freelancers 
			hired by Special Agent Gale to put an end to their investigation.
