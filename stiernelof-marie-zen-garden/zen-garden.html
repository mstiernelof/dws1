		<h1>CSS Zen Garden Examples</h1>
		<ol>
			<li><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/218"><h2>Apothecary</h2></a></li>
			<p>I like that its really simple and balanced but still eye catching.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>CSS used to change font size, text-align, header background transparent.</li>
				<li>Text color change in h1, body, h3, and links change color when you hover over them.</li>
				<li>I like the background triangle and how it bleeds off the page. (Margin changed to 0, triangle itself made with css)</li>					
				<li>I like the little hand that moves when you hover over it.</li>
			</ul>							
			<li><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/217"><h2>Handcrafted</h2></a></li>
			<p>Again pretty simple design but they layout and pops of color make it work.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Links are underline ad instead of the whole word changing color the underline changes color. (text-decoration: underline; color: #9685BA;)</li>
				<li>h1 was changed to be a whole lot smaller than the h2 tag which takes up practically the whole screen.</li>					
				<li>Text Colors changed. Backgrounds with color have white text. White backgrounds have black text.</li>		
				<li>Sidebar areas for text.  (.sidebar ul, .sidebar li)</li>				
	
			</ul>							
			<li><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/107"><h2>Defiance</h2></a>
			<p>Defiance is crazy looking. Style wise it's off-kilter, grungy and pretty cool. Readability is affected though.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Road to Enlightenment. Enlightenment is scratched out and hell is srcibbled over it. I have no idea how they did that.</li>
				<li>Background image pretty awesome. (Body: Background /Black/ screwoff.gif /no-repeat to left;)</li>							
				<li>When you hover over links the text gets crossed out.</li>				
				<li>h3 font changed to white.</li>						
				<li>Paragraphs aligned to the left or center.</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
