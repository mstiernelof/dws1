			<h2 id="about">About</h2>
			<p id="intro">
			Thailand, officially the Kingdom of Thailand), formerly known as Siam, is a 
			country located at the centre of the Indochina peninsula in Southeast Asia. 
			It is bordered to the north by Burma 
			and Laos, to the east by Laos and Cambodia, to the south by the Gulf of Thailand 
			and Malaysia, and to the west by the Andaman Sea and the southern extremity of 
			Burma. Its maritime boundaries include Vietnam in the Gulf of Thailand to the 
			southeast, and Indonesia and India in the Andaman Sea to the southwest.
			The country is a constitutional monarchy, headed by King Rama IX, the ninth king 
			of the House of Chakri, who, having reigned since 1946, is the world's 
			longest-serving current head of state and the longest-reigning monarch in Thai 
			history.[12] The king of Thailand is titled Head of State, Head of the Armed Forces, 
			Adherent of Buddhism, and Upholder of religions.[13] Thailand is the world's 
			51st-largest country in terms of total area, with an area of approximately 
			513,000 km2 (198,000 sq mi), and is the 20th-most-populous country, with around 
			64 million people. The capital and largest city is Bangkok, which is Thailand's 
			political, commercial, industrial and cultural hub. About 75–85% of the population 
			is ethnically Tai, which includes the four major regional groups of Central Thai 
			(Khon Pak Klang) : 30%, Northeastern Thai (Khon [Lao] Isan):[2] 22%, Northern 
			Thai (Khon Lanna): 9% and Southern Thai (Khon Tai): 7%. 14% are of significant 
			Chinese heritage (Thai Chinese)[5] and up to 40% have at least partly Chinese 
			ancestry.[14] 3% are ethnically Malay; the rest belong to minority groups including 
			Mons, Khmers and various "hill tribes". The country's official language is Thai. 
			The primary religion is Buddhism, which is practised by around 95% of the population.
			Thailand experienced rapid economic growth between 1985 and 1996, and is presently a newly industrialized country and a major exporter. Tourism also contributes significantly to the Thai economy.[15][16] There are approximately 2.2 million legal and illegal migrants in Thailand,[17] and the country has also attracted a number of expatriates from developed countries.[18]

			<h2 id="language">Language</h2>
			<p>
			<em>The official language of Thailand is Thai</em>, a Tai–Kadai language closely related 
			to Lao, Shan in Burma, and numerous smaller languages spoken in an arc from Hainan 
			and Yunnan south to the Chinese border. It is the principal language of education 
			and government and spoken throughout the country. The standard is based on the 
			dialect of the central Thai people, and it is written in the Thai alphabet, an 
			abugida script that evolved from the Khmer script. Several other dialects exist, 
			and coincide with the regional designations. Southern Thai is spoken in the 
			southern provinces, and Northern Thai is spoken in the provinces that were formerly 
			part of the independent kingdom of Lannathai. Thailand is also host to several 
			other minority languages, the largest of which is the Lao dialect of Isan spoken 
			in the northeastern provinces. Although sometimes considered a Thai dialect, 
			it is a Lao dialect, and the region in where it is traditionally spoken was 
			historically part of the Lao kingdom of Lan Xang. In the far south, Yawi, a 
			dialect of Malay, is the primary language of the Malay Muslims. Varieties of 
			Chinese are also spoken by the large Chinese population, with Teochew being 
			best represented. Numerous tribal languages are also spoken, including those 
			belonging to the Mon–Khmer family, such as Mon, Khmer, Viet, Mlabri and Orang 
			Asli; Austronesian family, such as Cham and Moken; Sino-Tibetan family such as 
			Lawa, Akhan, and Karen; and other Tai languages such as Nyaw, Phu Thai, and Saek. 
			Hmong is a member of the Hmong–Mien languages, which is now regarded as a language 
			family of its own. English is a mandatory school subject, but the number of 
			fluent speakers remains very low, especially outside the cities.

			<h2 id="religion">Religion</h2>
			<p>
			<em>The most common religion is Theravada Buddhism</em>. Thai Buddhism ranks amongst the 
			highest in the world. According to the last census (2000) 94.6% of the total 
			population are Buddhists of the Theravada tradition. Muslims are the second 
			largest religious group in Thailand at 4.6%.[1][98] Thailand's southernmost 
			provinces – Pattani, Yala, Satun, Narathiwat and part of Songkhla Chumphon have 
			dominant Muslim populations, consisting of both ethnic Thai and Malay. The 
			southern tip of Thailand is mostly ethnically Malay, and most Malays are Sunni 
			Muslims. Christians represent 0.7% of the population. A small community of Sikhs 
			in Thailand and some Hindus also live in the country's cities. There is also a 
			small Jewish community in Thailand, dating back to the 17th century.

			<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>
			<p>
			Thai culture has been shaped by many influences, including Indian, Lao, Burmese, 
			Cambodian, and Chinese. Its traditions incorporate a great deal of influence 
			from India, China, Cambodia, and the rest of Southeast Asia. Thailand's national 
			religion Theravada Buddhism is important to modern Thai identity. Thai Buddhism 
			has evolved over time to include many regional beliefs originating from Hinduism, 
			animism as well as ancestor worship. The official calendar in Thailand is based 
			on the Eastern version of the Buddhist Era, which is 543 years ahead of the 
			Gregorian (western) calendar. For example, the year AD 2012 is 2555 BE in Thailand.
			Several different ethnic groups, many of which are marginalized, populate Thailand. 
			Some of these groups overlap into Burma, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaysia and have 
			mediated change between their traditional local culture, national Thai and global 
			cultural influences. Overseas Chinese also form a significant part of Thai society, 
			particularly in and around Bangkok. Their successful integration into Thai society 
			has allowed for this group to hold positions of economic and political power. 
			Thai Chinese businesses prosper as part of the larger bamboo network, a network 
			of overseas Chinese businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that 
			share common family and cultural ties.[99]

			<h3>Greetings</h3>
			<p>
			<em>The traditional Thai greeting, the wai</em>, is generally offered first by the younger 
			of the two people meeting, with their hands pressed together, fingertips pointing 
			upwards as the head is bowed to touch their face to the hands, usually coinciding 
			with the spoken word "Sawasdee khrap" for male speakers, and "Sawasdee ka" for 
			females. The elder then is to respond afterwards in the same way. Social status 
			and position, such as in government, will also have an influence on who performs 
			the wai first. For example, although one may be considerably older than a 
			provincial governor, when meeting it is usually the visitor who pays respect first. 
			When children leave to go to school, they are taught to wai to their parents to 
			represent their respect for them. The wai is a sign of respect and reverence 
			for another, similar to the namaste greeting of India and Nepal.
			</p>
			<h3>Cuisine</h3>
			<p>
			Thai cuisine blends five fundamental tastes: sweet, spicy, sour, bitter and salty. 
			Some common ingredients used in Thai cuisine include garlic, chillies, lime juice, 
			lemon grass, and fish sauce. The staple food in Thailand is rice, particularly 
			jasmine variety rice (also known as Hom Mali rice) which is included in almost 
			every meal. Thailand is the world's largest exporter of rice, and Thais 
			domestically consume over 100 kg of milled rice per person per year.[78] 
			Over 5000 varieties of rice from Thailand are preserved in the rice gene bank 
			of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), based in the Philippines. 
			The king of Thailand is the official patron of IRRI.[100]
			</p>
			<h3>Social Structure</h3>
			<p>
			Like most Asian cultures, respect towards ancestors is an essential part of 
			Thai spiritual practice. Thais have a strong sense of hospitality and generosity, 
			but also a strong sense of social hierarchy. Seniority is an important concept 
			in Thai culture. Elders have by tradition ruled in family decisions or ceremonies. 
			Older siblings have duties to younger ones. Taboos in Thailand include touching 
			someone's head or pointing with the feet, as the head is considered the most 
			sacred and the foot the dirtiest part of the body.

			<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
			<p>
				Totalling 513,120 square kilometres (198,120 sq mi),[1] Thailand is the 
				world's 51st-largest country by total area. It is slightly smaller than 
				Yemen and slightly larger than Spain. Thailand is home to several distinct 
				geographic regions, partly corresponding to the provincial groups. The north 
				of the country is the mountainous area of the Thai highlands, with the highest 
				point being Doi Inthanon in the Thanon Thong Chai Range at 2,565 metres 
				(8,415 ft) above sea level. The northeast, Isan, consists of the Khorat 
				Plateau, bordered to the east by the Mekong River. The centre of the country 
				is dominated by the predominantly flat Chao Phraya river valley, which runs 
				into the Gulf of Thailand. Southern Thailand consists of the narrow Kra Isthmus 
				that widens into the Malay Peninsula. Politically, there are six geographical 
				regions which differ from the others in population, basic resources, natural 
				features, and level of social and economic development. The diversity of the 
				regions is the most pronounced attribute of Thailand's physical setting.
				The Chao Phraya and the Mekong River are the sustainable resource of rural 
				Thailand. Industrial scale production of crops use both rivers and their 
				tributaries. The Gulf of Thailand covers 320,000 square kilometres 
				(124,000 sq mi) and is fed by the Chao Phraya, Mae Klong, Bang Pakong and 
				Tapi Rivers. It contributes to the tourism sector owing to its clear shallow 
				waters along the coasts in the Southern Region and the Kra Isthmus. The Gulf 
				of Thailand is also an industrial centre of Thailand with the kingdom's main 
				port in Sattahip along with being the entry gates for Bangkok's Inland Seaport.
				The Andaman Sea is regarded as Thailand's most precious natural resource as 
				it hosts the most popular and luxurious resorts in Asia. Phuket, Krabi, Ranong, 
				Phang Nga and Trang and their lush islands all lay along the coasts of the 
				Andaman Sea and despite the 2004 Tsunami, they continue to be and ever more so, 
				the playground of the rich and elite of Asia and the world. Plans have resurfaced 
				of a logistical connection of the two bodies of water which would be coined 
				the Thai Canal, analogous to the Suez and the Panama Canal. Such an idea has 
				been greeted with positive accounts by Thai politicians as it would cut 
				fees charged by the Ports of Singapore, improve ties with China and India, 
				lower shipping times and increase ship safety owing to pirate fears in the 
				Strait of Melaka and, support the Thai government's policy of being the 
				logistical hub for Southeast Asia. The ports would improve economic conditions 
				in the south of Thailand, which relies heavily on tourism income, and it would 
				also change the structure of the Thai economy moving it closer to a services 
				centre of Asia. The canal would be a major engineering project and has expected 
				costs of 20–30 billion dollars. The local climate is tropical and characterized 
				by monsoons. There is a rainy, warm, and cloudy southwest monsoon from mid-May 
				to September, as well as a dry, cool northeast monsoon from November to mid-March. 
				The southern isthmus is always hot and humid. This article incorporates public 
				domain material from websites or documents of the CIA World Factbook.
